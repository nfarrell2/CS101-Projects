This project is run in the terminal through 
    ./a.exe i|s input1.txt input2.txt
where a.exe is the executable, i|s is either the character 'i' or 's', and input1.txt/input2.txt
is two separate input text files with either string values or int values on each line, depending
on whether 'i' or 's' is input prior.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This project takes input as two text files with either an integer or string on each line, up to
20,000 on each.  The program then takes the files and prints out any values that are in both
text files, in sorted order.

If the command line character input indicates 'i' for integer, the sorting algorithm used is a
Merge Sort variation.  This specific Merge Sort was to be copied and pasted directly from the
online textbook, zyBooks, and used for grading purposes.

Alternatively, if the command line character input indicates 's' for string, the sorting algorithm
used was to be a Quicksort variation.  The specific Quicksort was also to be copied and pasted
directly from the same textbook.

This project utilized logical thinking to make effective code and required an understanding of 
different sorting algorithms so that intended output was achieved.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:
The program will fail if a string value text file is used with the 'i' input but the program will
run if an integer text file is used with the 's' input on account of array datatypes.
The max content in any given text file is 20,000 however during implementation when individual
arrays for each file are merged together, the size of the array is trimmed to fit exactly to the
amount of content variables, disregarding any duplicates in a single text file.

All code is my own unless otherwise mentioned, test cases were provided by the professor to ensure 
similar output among all students.
