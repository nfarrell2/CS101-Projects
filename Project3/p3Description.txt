This project is run in the terminal through 
    ./a.exe < cmd.txt
where a.exe is the executable, and cmd.txt is a text file containing the test commands for the project.
This project declares the classes used in a heading file, p3.h, and the class functions are declared
separately in their own source file, p3.cpp.  Because of this, both main.cpp and p3.cpp have to be
compiled together when compiling the project.  The terminal command used to compile on the local machine is:
    g++ main.cpp p3.cpp

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This project takes user input directly from the terminal command line.  For ease of testing, a txt file with
the input commands were written to cmd.txt and are sent directly to the program when run in the terminal.  The
project takes first and last names as input for a new Contact object on a ContactList linked list object and
then has the option to add unique Info objects to a linked list under individual Contacts.

The project allows the user to either add Contact and Info objects sequentially to their respective lists or
for the user to add them in alphabetical order through the "AddContactOrdered" and "AddInfoOrdered" methods.
Additionally, the user can remove Contact and Info objects from the list and has the option to print the list.

This project utilizes classes, header files, linked lists, constructors, destructors, deep-copy copy 
constructors, and deep-copy copy assignment operators
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:
The program will not perform as intended if both AddContact and AddContactOrdered are used in the same run.
This follows for AddInfo and AddInfoOrdered.
Although the cmd.txt file allowed for ease of testing when building the project, the main.cpp file is set up
so that a user can interact with the program directly if desired.
