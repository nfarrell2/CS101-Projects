This project is run in the terminal through 
    ./a.exe database.csv #col_width
where a.exe is the executable, database.csv is a csv file, and #col_width is an integer
value depicting column width.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS:
The program runs 6 different commands:
  print
  cols
  search *|col_name val
  min col_name
  max col_name
  avg col_name
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS:
The command "print" prints out the entire csv file in a table to the terminal where the 
column width is the integer #col_width declared in the command line.

The command "cols" prints out the names of each column of the csv file.

The command "search" can be followed by either an asterisk or a column name.  If the command
is followed by an asterisk, the program prints out the rows of the table that contain the
val argument.  If a column name is input instead, the rows are filtered by only the rows which
contain the val argument in the specified column.

The command "min" is followed by the name of a column containing int or double values.  The
command returns the smallest value in the column.

The command "max" is followed by the name of a column containing int or double values.  The
command returns the largest value in the column.

The command "avg" is followed by the name of a column containing int or double values.  The
command returns the average value of the column.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDGE CASES:
The program will fail if min/max/avg is called with a non int/double column.
The csv file has a column "Empty" with no value in it to check for spacing correctness.
